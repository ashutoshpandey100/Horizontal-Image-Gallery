# 🖼️ Horizontal Image Gallery

A sleek, modern, and interactive **horizontal scrolling image gallery** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Users can navigate through images using scroll gestures or by clicking **Next** and **Back** buttons.  
Each image smoothly transitions with grayscale and zoom hover effects.

---

## 📸 Features

- 🎞️ **Smooth Horizontal Scroll** – Scroll images with mouse wheel or navigation buttons.  
- 🖱️ **Hover Effects** – Subtle grayscale to color transition and zoom effect.  
- 💫 **Smooth Animation** – Smooth scroll behavior for a better user experience.  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works well on desktop and modern browsers.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – For structure  
- **CSS3** – For layout and design  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – For scrolling and navigation functionality  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The gallery container (`.gallery`) is scrollable horizontally.  
- The **Next** (`next.png`) and **Back** (`back.png`) buttons move the gallery by 300px per click.  
- The mouse wheel scrolls horizontally instead of vertically.  
- Hovering over any image removes the grayscale filter and slightly zooms the image.
